## Script to run bowtie2 alignment on the unmapped reads from teh HNSC TCGA data set.
## INPUT: $1 is the name of the file with the list of fastq files to process.
## INPUT: $2 is the number of jobs to process in parallel.
#
## To Run: Go to directory where you want the realigned files to be saved and run from there.  The input file $1 needs to have the relative path to the fastq files wrt the directory you run this script from.
## Define maxjobs function
function maxjobs {
        if [ $# -ne 1 ]
        then
                num=1
        else
                num=$1
        fi

        while [ `jobs -r | wc -l` -ge $num ]
        do
                sleep 2
        done
}

echo "MY SCRIPT: Starting alignments on `date`"

cat $1 | while read file
do
	base=`basename $file .bam.fasta`
	maxjobs $2
	echo "MYSCRIPT: Started on `date`: "$file
