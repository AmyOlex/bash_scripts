## The bash commands I used to merge the PerExonCoverage columns into one file

## First cd to the directory that has the files
## Run the below command to past together all the files in columns
## The awk command parses out all the data columns from the row-names since the row names are going to be identical for each file.

OUT=$1

paste `ls *PerTargetCoverage*` | awk '{out=$1"\t"$2"\t"$3"\t"$4"\t"$5; for (i=7; i<=NF; i+=8){out=out"\t"$i}; print out }' >> tmp.txt

## Next I need to the column headers, which is the same order as the `ls` command.
ls *PerTargetCoverage* | one-liner | sed -e 's/ /\t/g' > headers.txt

## Now I cat the files together, then I manually edited the file to add a new line inbetween the header and the first line, and to remove the last two file names from the header list.
cat headers.txt tmp.txt > $OUT
