## Script to run bowtie2 alignment on the paired end unmapped reads from the HNSC TCGA WGS data set.
## INPUT: $1 is the name of the file with the list of fastq files to process, fq1 and fq2 are on same line seperated by a tab.
## INPUT: $2 is the number of jobs to process in parallel.
##
## UPDATE 9/27/16: I added a pipe so that the output is	a BAM file to a	specified directory instead of a SAM file in the working directory.
##
## To Run: Go to directory where you want the realigned files to be saved and run from there.  The input file $1 needs to have the relative path to the fastq files wrt the directory you run this script from.
