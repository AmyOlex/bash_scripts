## Script to run bowtie2 alignment on the paired end unmapped reads from the HNSC TCGA WGS data set.
## INPUT: $1 is the name of the file with the list of fastq files to process, fq1 and fq2 are on same line seperated by a tab.
## INPUT: $2 is the number of jobs to process in parallel.
#
## To Run: Go to directory where you want the realigned files to be saved and run from there.  The input file $1 needs to have the relative path to the fastq files wrt the directory you run this script from.
## Define maxjobs function
function maxjobs {
        if [ $# -ne 1 ]
        then
                num=1
        else
                num=$1
        fi

        while [ `jobs -r | wc -l` -ge $num ]
        do
                sleep 2
        done
}

echo "MY SCRIPT: Starting alignments on `date`"

cat $1 | while read file1 file2
do
	base=$(basename $file1 .bam.1.fastq)
	out=`echo $base".realigned.pe.sam"`
	if [ ! -e $out ]
	then
		maxjobs $2
		echo "MYSCRIPT: Started on `date`: "$base
		bowtie2 -x /var/tcga/HNSC/RNAseq-aligned/refGenomes/selected_viral_sequences_all -1 $file1 -2 $file2 --end-to-end --threads 2 --very-sensitive --quiet -S $base.realigned.pe.sam &
